# Guest-Revenue-Demographics


Project Overview

This project visualizes guest and revenue data for a healthcare-service context. It presents:

Guest Demographics: age, gender, blood group, admission types, medical conditions, and preferred VAS (Value Added Services) usage.

Revenue Summary: total billing, VAS income, hospital payouts, and popularity of different VAS plans.

The visualizations highlight insights such as guest counts, common medical conditions (e.g. diabetes, hypertension, arthritis), popular VAS services (e.g. diabetes management, heart disease management, arthritis support), and revenue drivers (top VAS plans, VAS income amounts, hospital liability).
